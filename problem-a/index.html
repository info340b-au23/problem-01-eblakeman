        <p>
            Supergirl, also known as Kara Danverns, comes from the Netflix TV show
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergirl_(TV_series)"> Supergirl</a> !
            Kara came to Earth with her cousin Clark Kent, also known as Superman. However, they
            each lived their own lives separately only keeping in touch every once in a while.
            During the day Kara works as the editor-in-chief of CatCo Worlwide Media, but if
            someone is trouble, she comes to their assistance.
